                        Although! I had pretty good knowledge about the subject already, I learned a lot about the nitty-gritty of many niche tags and learned about how to make my code more readable.

                        This subject is also one of those that I had learned in my Bachelor's but in these sessions, I got to learn those few recondite yet interesting details which make the classes like a whole new experience.

                        It's one of those subjects that seems easy yet if we miss one session the whole concept seems to fly away from our understanding. apart from learning about the subject matter I also learned to be more punctual as the facility is very good yet very strict.

                        It is quite amusing to learn about how an operating system works. yet again this is something I have already been familiar with but taking these classes has shown me how much I didn't know at that time.

                        C language was introduced to me 3 years ago and still, I always find something that I had no idea about before. I've learned data types before but e.g., the fact that there is type specification and data types that are stored in header files was something that I knew but weren't very familiar with. all and all It's a great experience to take these sessions.

                        This is one of those subjects that most students don't care about, it is theoretical and we can score very easily. But, it has been more than just a scoring subject this time. It's been more of development at a core level. I've learned a lot about very inspiring faces, and I think this subject helps us understand others.

                        If I'd be honest I don't think maths could ever be "Discrete". It's the only subject that relates to everything and itself. I enjoy doing maths cause I'm always certain of how much I know. It's been great learning different topics and how they relate to real-life scenarios.
